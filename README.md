### [Project 1: Core features of the Pandas library](https://github.com/shap0011/machine_learning_fall_2024/blob/main/Pandas_Class.ipynb)

---

In the **Pandas_class.ipynb** file, I explore the core features of the Pandas library, a vital tool for data manipulation in Python. The file covers the following topics:  

- **Creating a Python Library and Accessing it in Google Colab**: Mounting a Google Drive folder to integrate external files into the Colab environment.  
- **Importing Modules (Pandas)**: Setting up the environment for efficient data analysis.  
- **Pandas DataFrame**: Reading data from a CSV file and exploring structured data tables.  
- **Indexing DataFrame**: Utilizing `.loc` and `.iloc` methods to perform operations such as retrieving values from specific rows and columns, selecting multiple rows, and specifying ranges of rows and columns.  
- **Manipulating DataFrame**: Executing operations such as adding new columns and rows, sorting the DataFrame, dropping rows and columns, removing duplicates, and checking for missing values.  
- **Reading Data from Different Sources**: Loading datasets from formats like `.xlsx`, `.txt`, `.zip`, `.html`, and `.json`.  

This project highlights practical skills in data handling.

**Descriptive Statistics - GoodLife Fitness Case Study**  

In the **Goodlife_Fitness_Solutions.ipynb** file, I perform a descriptive analysis to create customer profiles for each GoodLife Fitness membership option. This analysis explores key statistical insights and visualizations, covering the following topics:  

- **Importing Libraries and Loading the Dataset**: Import the necessary Python packages and load the *GoodlifeFitness.csv* dataset.  
- **Basic Data Exploration**: Print basic information about the dataset, check for null values, and review the structure of the data.  
- **Univariate Analysis**:  
  - Examine the five-number summary statistics.  
  - Analyze the dataset's summary, including descriptive stats for categorical data.  
- **Visualization of Numerical Distributions**:  
  - Plot the distribution of numerical columns such as *Age*.  
  - Create boxplots to identify outliers in *Age*.  
- **Categorical Data Analysis**:  
  - Determine value counts for each categorical column, including *Type*.  
  - Calculate the percentage distribution of user types using normalization.  
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Visualize relationships, such as plotting a boxplot to compare *Income* with *Membership Type*.  
- **Multivariate Analysis**:  
  - Use `pd.crosstab` to analyze data across *Gender* and *Type*.  
  - Apply `pd.pivot_table` to explore data by *Income* and *Type*.  
  - Create scatter plots using Pandas for further insights.  

This case study demonstrates the application of descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to uncover actionable insights in the context of fitness memberships.
