### [Project 1: Core features of the Pandas library](https://github.com/shap0011/machine_learning_fall_2024/blob/main/Pandas_Class.ipynb)

***

In the **Pandas_class.ipynb** file, I explore the core features of the Pandas library, a vital tool for data manipulation in Python. The file covers the following topics:  

- **Creating a Python Library and Accessing it in Google Colab**: Mounting a Google Drive folder to integrate external files into the Colab environment.  
- **Importing Modules (Pandas)**: Setting up the environment for efficient data analysis.  
- **Pandas DataFrame**: Reading data from a CSV file and exploring structured data tables.  
- **Indexing DataFrame**: Utilizing `.loc` and `.iloc` methods to perform operations such as retrieving values from specific rows and columns, selecting multiple rows, and specifying ranges of rows and columns.  
- **Manipulating DataFrame**: Executing operations such as adding new columns and rows, sorting the DataFrame, dropping rows and columns, removing duplicates, and checking for missing values.  
- **Reading Data from Different Sources**: Loading datasets from formats like `.xlsx`, `.txt`, `.zip`, `.html`, and `.json`.  

This project highlights practical skills in data handling and serves as a valuable component of my Machine Learning Portfolio.
